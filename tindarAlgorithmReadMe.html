=================

This repo contains the portion of the 'Tindar' background that relate to the swiping algorithm, that allows users to load a deck and swipe through potential matches. This document outlines that algorithm, and my testing process to ensure it was successful.
The 'Usage' section describes how one can run the same tests on their local computer.

Background on Application
=================
'Tindar' is a Dartmouth specific dating app. It parodies the popular application 'Tinder', in it's purpose (to connect users romantically). However, it also parodies 'LinkedIn', by replacing standard terms with business-related ones.
For example, each user is called an 'applicant'. And, if one wants to pursue a connection with another applicant, instead of 'liking' their profile, one gives out an 'offer'.

'Tindar' also differentiates itself from other applications with a few unique features.

Referals
--------------------------------
An applicant can make a ’referral’ between any two other applicants. For example, applicant A is friends with applicants B and C, who would like to explore a potential romantic connection. Applicant A can make a referral between applicants B and C, and they will match with each other. Every 48 hours, applicant A can refer any two applicants.

Endorsements
--------------------------------
An applicant can ’endorse’ another applicant’s skills. For example, assume applicant A is a friend of applicant B. Applicant A can submit a message to endorse applicant B.
The users with the most endorsements will appear on a separate leaderboard page of the application. Any applicant can scroll through this leaderboard. The leader board will show the endorsed applicant’s profile, their ranking (position on the leader board, determined by number of endorsements), and their endorsement messages they have received will interchange beneath the profile.


The Algorithm
=================

The algorithm draws a queue of users, that a person can 'swipe' through.
We call this queue a 'deck'. It contains 10 users.
User's must be compatible with eachother in terms of sex and sexuality. Additionally, if a user has already 'disliked' another, they are not compatible to see eachother in the deck.
There are several other intricacies. For example, if a user has 'blacklisted' another, they are not compatible to match. These are elaborated in the comments of 'algorithm.py'.

Furthermore, we wanted to optimize the algorithm so that a user can meet new people, while also 'responding' to people who have already liked their own profile.
Consider the following situation:
- User A00 is a straight female, who seeks to draw a new deck of people to swipe through
- Users B00 through B99 are all straight men, who have seen A00's profile. They have all swiped 'yes' on her profile, to give her an offer
- If we left it up to chance, it could take an extremely long time for A00 to see B00 through B99's profile in her algorithm. A00 needs to see these profiles, in order to swipe on them, and then match.
- Thus, I decided to weight the deck, such that A00 will be able to see the people who liked her, without waiting to stumble upon their profiles by chance. I call this list of people who A00 is responding to, her **'response list'**
- In A00's case, there are 99 applicants who have liked her. If her entire queue was made up of her response list, she never would get the chance to see people who have never seen and liked her. Imagine users C00 through C99 are all straight males, who might like A00, but they have never had the opportunity to swipe on her. And, she has never had the opportunity to swipe on them.
- I ensure that A00 can see users C00-C99 by creating the **'unmet list'**. This is a group of users that has never swiped on A00, and A00 has never swiped on them.
- Thus, the full deck is made up of the response list, and the unmet list.
- The percent of the deck that is the response list and the percent of the deck will shift depending on a user's specific situation
- 'algorithm.py' contains comments that specify the exact calculations



Testing
=================

The three provided tests ensure that the algorithm is equipped to handle all cases that may occur. This includes a more common case, where a user loads a deck of 10 people to swipe through... 7 of whome are 'unmet', and 3 of whome are 'responses'.
We also examine edge cases, where someone has nobody left to swipe through.

The comments throughout the test files describe in detail what each test is for. So, for the sake of brevity and clarity, I will leave the explanations strictly in TEST files.
